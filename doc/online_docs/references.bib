abstract = {Over the past two decades, pharmaceutical manufacturing has seen significant modernization due to the digitalization of manufacturing as more manufacturers adopt Industry 4.0 standards. The FDA launched the quality-by-design and quality-by-control initiatives as steps to ensure this digitalization in pharmaceutical manufacturing may proceed alongside regulatory guidelines for the transition from traditional batchwise manufacturing to end-to-end continuous or hybrid batch-continuous manufacturing schemes. Adoption of a process digital twin is a pivotal step in providing quantitative justification for updating or designing new processing routes for pharmaceutical materials, especially when implementing online process control. This article presents a framework for the integrated design of continuous and hybrid systems for the synthesis-crystallization and filtration-drying steps of paracetamol using digital twins to simulate process operation and control.},
